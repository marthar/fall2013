              <h4>Understanding Credit Score</h4>
              <p> When I turned 18, I was privileged to have my mother teach me about Credit Cards and the benefits of having them at a young age. She taught me the basic dos and donts, and helped me sign up for one. Establishing good credit is necessary for many things in your future, and I felt I had good knowledge to stay on track, and improve my credit score. 
                <br><br>
                Going to college, it was brought to my attention that many of my friends did not have a credit card, nor were they going to get one any time soon. This is where I got my idea for a credit score game. They claimed they did not have time to learn about credit cards because of their busy schedules. 
                <br><br>
                Understanding Credit Scores is a quick game that covers all the basics of your credit score. While clicking through some brief scenarios, you are prompted to decide whether your credit score will increase, decrease, or stay the same. After answering, you find out if you were correct, and learn a bit about your answer. The website provides you with a quick and easy way to learn about credit scores, and why it is a good idea to start establishing credit now!
